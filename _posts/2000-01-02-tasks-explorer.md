<!--begin excerpt-->

Tasks Explorer is a freeware opensource computer program providing functionality for collecting extended information about processes running in system in real time.

Application Tasks Explorer was designed as alternative to Apple's "Activity Monitor", as information providing "Activity Monitor" does not correspond with the needs of software developers and advanced users. Process Explorer from Sysinternals whose features are needed in Mac OS X was selected as a standard.
